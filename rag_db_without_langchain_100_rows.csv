Long-Term Persistence of Borrelia burgdorferi Antigens and DNA in the Tissues of a Patient with Lyme Disease
Abstract: Whether Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, can persist for long periods in the human body has been a controversial question. The objective of this study was to see if we could find B. burgdorferi in a Lyme disease patient after a long clinical course and after long-term antibiotic treatment. Therefore, we investigated the potential presence of B. burgdorferi antigens and DNA in human autopsy tissues from a well-documented serum-, PCR-, and culture-positive Lyme disease patient, a 53-year-old female from northern Westchester County in the lower Hudson Valley Region of New York State, who had received extensive antibiotic treatments during extensive antibiotic treatments over the course of her 16-year-long illness. We also asked what form the organism might take, with special interest in the recently found antibiotic-resistant aggregate form, biofilm. We also examined the host tissues for the presence of inflammatory markers such as CD3 + T lymphocytes. Autopsy tissue sections of the brain, heart, kidney, and liver were analyzed by histological and immunohistochemical methods (IHC), confocal microscopy, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) metagenomics. We found / significant pathological changes, including borrelial spirochetal clusters, in all of the organs using IHC combined with confocal microscopy. The aggregates contained a well-established biofilm marker, alginate, on their surfaces, suggesting they are true biofilm. We found B. burgdorferi DNA by FISH, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and an independent verification by WGS metagenomics, / which resulted in the detection of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto specific DNA sequences.

Long-Term Persistence of Borrelia burgdorferi Antigens and DNA in the Tissues of a Patient with Lyme Disease
burgdorferi can persist in the human body, not only in the spirochetal but also in the antibiotic-resistant biofilm form, even after long-term antibiotic treatment.

Introduction
Lyme borreliosis, a tick-borne multisystemic illness caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, has grown into a major public health problem [1-5]. The frontline treatment for Lyme disease is the administration of antibiotics [6-8]. However, relapse of the disease often occurs, with lingering symptoms when treatment is discontinued, regardless of the choice of antibiotics [9-14]. The question is whether or not the persistent symptoms are related to ongoing spirochetal infection despite antibiotic therapy [15]. In vivo animal studies with immunocompetent mice, dog, and non-human primate models have identified a surviving, but not cultivatable form of B. burgdorferi that can withstand antibiotic treatment [16-20]. Recent studies on rhesus macaques and mice confirmed these observations by demonstrating a metabolically active, persistent B. burgdorferi post-treatment in antibiotic-treated animals [20-24]. There are also human studies providing clinical evidence that a chronic form of Lyme disease could be caused by a persistent spirochetal infection, which could explain the lingering symptoms [25-28].
It has been previously suggested that antibiotic-resistant forms of Borrelia might be due to the formation of alternative morphologies, such as 'round bodies' (cyst and granules), which were first identified and studied in the 1990s by Drs. Øystein Brorson and Alan MacDonald [29,30].

Introduction
One such alternative form is called biofilm. Bacterial biofilms are responsible for several chronic diseases such as periodontitis, osteomyelitis, bacterial endocarditis, and even chronic lung infection in cystic fibrosis patients [33-37]. Organisms in biofilms are particularly di GLYPH<14> cult to eliminate because their antibiotic resistance can be as much as 1000-fold greater than that of their free-living counterparts [35-37]. The biofilm resistance is based upon multiple mechanisms, such as incomplete penetration of the antibiotics into the matrix, inactivation of antibiotics by altered microenvironment within the biofilm, and a highly protected, resistant bacterial population [38-40]. In the past few years we have provided substantial evidence that B. burgdorferi sensu lato and stricto are indeed capable of forming biofilms in vivo and in vitro [41-43]. Many of the important biofilm traits like structural rearrangements in the biofilm and the development of protective matrices on the surface were identified not just in cultured spirochetes but also in human skin borrelial lymphocytoma biopsy tissues [41-43]. Specific biofilm markers, such as characteristic protective layers containing alginate, extracellular DNA, and calcium channels and protrusions, can be found in Borrelia biofilm in vitro and in vivo [41-43]. We have also reported that B. burgdorferi biofilm formation dramatically increases the resistance to antibiotics [44-46]. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that biofilm formation by B. burgdorferi could play a significant role in their survival in diverse environmental conditions by providing refuge for individual cells. The formation of biofilm by B. burgdorferi could also change the way we think about Lyme disease, especially in patients where infection seems to persist despite long-term antibiotic treatment.","antibiotics-08-00183.pdf","{""1.

Introduction
Here we report a patient with serum-, PCR-, and culture-positive Lyme disease who had received extensive antibiotic treatment over 16 years. We asked if we could find evidence of Borrelia after the antibiotic therapies and, if so, what form the organism might take. We explored the hypothesis that antibiotic-resistant forms of B. burgdorferi might exist in Borrelia -infected human autopsy tissues and that the persistent infection might be associated with the corresponding pathological findings. Therefore, weevaluated autopsy tissues from this patient for pathological findings and for the presence of borrelial spirochetes and biofilms using immunohistochemical methods (IHC), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) metagenomics / methods.

Clinical History
A39-year-old woman with at least a two-year history of spastic paraparesis, cranial nerve palsies, and lymphocytic CSF pleocytosis was first evaluated by one of the authors (K.L.) in 1989. The patient had lived in a tick-infested cottage community in northern Westchester County in the lower Hudson Valley Region of New York State, a highly epidemic area for Lyme disease. She also resided in northern California. There was no history of tick attachment or of eruptions suspicious for erythema migrans. Athorough evaluation for Lyme disease was entirely negative.

Clinical History
She was treated empirically for Lyme disease with 21 days of intravenous cefotaxime (2 g, every 8 h) in April 1990. CSF pleocytosis prior to and following treatment was unchanged, as was her clinical status. She did not improve after four months of oral minocycline. She became home- and wheelchair-bound. She did not have any pets. It is unlikely that she was infected in the interim between April 1990 and December 1991. CSF was re-examined in December 1991 and revealed a lymphocytic pleocytosis. Spinal fluid placed in BSK-II medium and cultured at the Centers for Disease Control, (Fort Collins, CO, USA) yielded a growth of spirochetes several weeks later, confirmed by PCR to be B. burgdorferi . A'pulse' regimen of cefotaxime starting in January 1992 (4 g, every 8 GLYPH<2> 3 consecutive doses, once weekly for 13 weeks) resolved the pleocytosis. Her clinical status and gait improved modestly. The 'pulse' regimen was intensified (cefotaxime 4 g every 8 h GLYPH<2> 6 consecutive doses, weekly) for 10 months, but her condition slowly worsened. Intravenous antibiotic therapy was discontinued and she was transferred to the Mayo Clinic, (Rochester, MN, USA) for consideration of the placement of a baclofen pump in view of her lower extremity spasticity and for a further opinion regarding management. A test dose of baclofen, although reducing spasticity, made it impossible for her to stand or transfer, so this approach was abandoned.

Clinical History
In May 1993, she became unable to hold a cup, roll over in bed, or remember conversations held minutes earlier. A CT scan of the chest revealed pleuropericardial e GLYPH<11> usions. A pericardial window was created. A touch-preparation of the pericardium revealed a Borrelia -compatible spirochete and histology showed pericarditis with infiltration by macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Aphycoerythrin stain showed spirochetal-compatible structures.
Treatment with 109 continuous days of intravenous cefotaxime (2 g, IV every 8 h) resulted in dramatic improvement in encephalopathy and enabled her to ambulate 500 feet with a rolling walker. The pleuropericardial e GLYPH<11> usions resolved. Daily intravenous cefotaxime was continued for an additional three months. In the ensuing months o GLYPH<11> treatment, she became increasingly encephalopathic. Daily intravenous cefotaxime was re-instituted in October 1994.
Neuropsychological testing undertaken before and after four months of this treatment demonstrated a modest objective improvement in cognitive function. This patient was a well-functioning and highly valued pediatric intensive care nurse prior to falling ill. She underwent formal detailed neuropsychological testing in October 1994 and again in February 1995 in order to assess her cognitive status and the impact, if any, of treatment with a four-month course of intravenous cefotaxime (2 g every 8 h). On objective neuropsychological tests, she showed marked memory deficits. Following treatment, she showed a modest improvement in visual memory, delayed recall of verbal memory, and meaningfully increased scores in attention and concentration. Despite the applied treatment, she continued to have profound deficits in memory, in striking contrast to her overall verbal intelligence, which, on testing, fell within the superior range.","antibiotics-08-00183.pdf","{""1.1.

Clinical History
Changesinthepatient's insurer's policies for reimbursement prevented further antibiotic treatment and her condition deteriorated. Serial CSF examinations revealed variable pleocytosis. Lyme ELISA, which had seroconverted in December 1991, subsequently was serovariable, and Western blots, although showing bands of high specificity for Lyme disease, often failed to satisfy the CDC criteria for
five out of 10 CDC-specific IgG bands. B. burgdorferi DNAwas demonstrated by PCR in the patient's blood on multiple occasions between 1995 and 2001.
Treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone (4 g, three days per week), donated by the manufacturer, in late September 2000 and mid-March 2001, with some hiatuses, for a total of 36 administered doses, did not yield an apparent clinical benefit.
Following a change in her insurance to public health benefits, intravenous cefotaxime 2 grams three times per day was applied for three weeks starting on 27 May 2003, but was suspended because there was no mechanism for reimbursement to the facility. While attempts to secure means of reimbursement were underway, on 6 July 2003, and despite therapeutic diphenylhydantoin levels for a seizure disorder that had developed earlier in the course of her illness (onset: May 2000), she sustained a series of grand mal seizures and was transported by ambulance to a local hospital. Seizures were controlled with the adjustment of anti-epileptic therapy, but hypotension developed. After discussion between the hospital physicians and the next of kin, a Do Not Resuscitate Order was issued. Shortly thereafter, the patient expired.

Pathological Findings-CNS and PNS
The brain leptomeninges contained infiltrates composed of chronic inflammatory cells, principally lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages (Figure 1a). A number of meningeal vessels had been occluded and recanalized (Figure 1b), but there were no acutely occluded vessels. Blood vessels in the cortex, subcortical white matter, basal ganglia, and thalamus displayed perivascular accumulations of lymphocytes and macrophages, with rare plasma cells (Figure 1d), but no evidence of an acute vasculitis. The parenchyma contained a large number of small infarcts, a GLYPH<11> ecting both gray and white matter of the hemispheres (Figure 1c,e and Figure 2a,b). Although we found these pathological features in many areas of the hemispheres, the frontal cortex and subcortical white matter were the most severely a GLYPH<11> ected. Infarcts were present in the internal capsule, which produced a degeneration of the corticospinal tract, visualized with a Bielschowsky silver stain of the spinal cord (Figure 2d). Infarcts were also present in the cerebellum (Figure 2c). We found chronic inflammatory infiltrates around blood vessels in cranial nerves (Figure 2e). There was no indication of cranial nerve degeneration, based on myelin or silver stains in our samples. Antibiotics 2019 , 8 , x 5 of 23

IHC FISH Confocal Microscopy Results / /
We evaluated four di GLYPH<11> erent autopsy tissues (heart, kidney, liver, and brain) for the potential presence of the Borrelia antigen using B. burgdorferi -specific IHC, FISH, PCR, WGS, and metagenomics methods. To investigate the potential presence of Borrelia biofilms in those autopsy tissues, we also utilized a biofilm-specific marker, alginate, in double immunofluorescence staining, as described previously [50]. The obtained images were analyzed by fluorescence and confocal microscopy.
In the first set of IHC experiments, 50 sections from each of the four organs (brain, heart, kidney, and liver) were immunostained with a monoclonal antibody specific for B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Wefound evidence for B. burgdorferi -positive spirochetal clusters and aggregates in all organs. (Figure 5, Panels A, E, I, and M). Furthermore, using an anti-alginate antibody, we found evidence of large biofilm-like aggregates (Figure 5, Panels A, E, I, and K; green arrows) in all organs. To determine the specificity of the antibodies, nonspecific IgG was used as a negative control in all IHC experiments (Figure 5, Panels C, G, K, and O). The morphology of the tissues was visualized using di GLYPH<11> erential interference contrast microscopy (DIC) (Figure 5, Panels D, H, L, and P).

(Figures 5, Panels C, G, K, and O). The morphology of the tissues was visualized using differential interference contrast microscopy (DIC) (Figures 5, Panels D, H, L, and P).
To quantify our IHC findings, we next examined additional consecutive sections from each of the four organs for the number and size of B. burgdorferi biofilms (Table 1). A total of 250 brain tissue sections were immunostained as described above; the results showed 0-4 biofilms per slide ranging from 20-150 µ min size. In heart sections (155), we found that each section contained 0-6 biofilms, with sizes in the range of 20-100 µ m. Kidney tissue sections (165) contained 0-4 biofilms section in the range / of 20-200 µ min size. We found the largest and greatest number of biofilms in the 180 liver sections with 0-7 biofilms section in the range of 20-300 / µ min size. Statistical analyses of the number of biofilm structures in the di GLYPH<11> erent organs, however, showed no significant di GLYPH<11> erences.

Table 1. Quantitative analysis of the IHC experiments on Borrelia biofilms in brain, heart, kidney, and liver tissues. SD = standard deviation.
Figures S1-S4 provide more examples for the B. burgdorferi / alginate-positive biofilm structures in the brain, heart, kidney, and liver autopsy tissues, respectively. In these experiments, we included additional controls to ensure the specificity of our IHC procedures. For example, we performed alginate IHC on consecutive slides to demonstrate independent Borrelia and alginate staining on the
same biofilm. Furthermore, in addition to the nonspecific IgG negative control, we also included autopsy tissues of the brain, heart, kidney, and liver from a similarly aged patient with no pathological changes in any of these organs. Those negative control autopsy tissue sections were immunostained for B. burgdorferi / alginate following the same IHC procedure and showed no positive staining for either B. burgdorferi or alginate antigens (Figures S1-S4, Panels I, J). Furthermore, we purchased commercially available healthy tissue slides for all four organs (20 slides each) and immunostained them for / B. burgdorferi and alginate antigens and found no evidence of any positive staining for B. burgdorferi and alginate antigens in those tissue sections (data not shown). As an independent verification for the IHC experiments, brain sections from the case were sent to the Innsbruck Medical Center (Innsbruck, Austria) and IHC was performed as described previously [50]. Figure S5 shows a representative image of IHC staining of brain tissue for B. burgdorferi (red staining with red arrows).","antibiotics-08-00183.pdf","{""2.4.

The spatial distribution of the alginate staining in a Borrelia spirochete and aggregate positive heart tissue was also investigated. Figure 6 shows that Borrelia -positive spirochete clusters (green staining, green arrow) do not stain for alginate, while the Borrelia -positive aggregate had significant amounts of alginate on the surface (blue staining, blue arrow). To prove further that the B. burgdorferi and biofilm marker alginate antigens were colocalized, we performed confocal microscopy analyses on IHC-positive tissue sections. Figure 7 provides a representative confocal microcopy image of a B. burgdorferi - and alginate-positive aggregate in liver autopsy tissue. The spatial distribution of the obtained fluorescent staining pattern confirmed the colocalization of B. burgdorferi and alginate antigens and showed that the alginate is on the surface on a well-formed B. burgdorferi -positive aggregate.

We then looked for the presence of B. burgdorferi DNA associated with the biofilms in all four organs using a previously validated and published FISH procedure combined with alginate IHC [43]. FISH results showed the aggregates are positive for B. burgdorferi -specific 16S rDNA in all four tissues (Figure 8, Panels A, G, M, and S; green arrow). The B. burgdorferi DNApositive aggregates, but not the spirochetes (Figure 8, Panel G; small green arrowhead), also immunostained with the alginate antibody (Figure 8, Panels B, H, N, and T; blue arrow). DIC microscopy was used to visualize the morphology of the biofilm structure and the surrounding tissue (Figure 8, Panels C, I, O, and U). For negative controls

We also conducted a quantitative analysis of FISH-IHC experimental data on a total of 210 brain, 130 heart, 145 kidney, and 150 liver consecutive tissue sections for the size and frequency of B. burgdorferi biofilms. The obtained results showed some but not statistically di GLYPH<11> erent variations, as we found in the IHC analyses: brain tissues contained 0-3 biofilms per slide, with a biofilm size of 20-150 µ m, while heart and kidney tissues containing 0-4 biofilms per slide had a biofilm size in the range of 20-100 µ m.

PCR results for all four organs (brain, heart, kidney, and liver) resulted in B. burgdorferi -positive DNA. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST, NBCI) analyses confirmed a 99-100% identity to B. burgdorferi sensu strictro strains (data not shown). Because of the known problem with false PCR positivity in clinical samples [51], we also sent out the DNA samples for independent verification. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS), combined with metagenomic analyses, was performed as described in Materials and Methods at PerkinElmer DNA Sequencing and Analyzing Services (Branford, CT, USA) on genomic DNA extracted from all four tissues. Because of the high degradation of the 16 + -year-old samples, only liver tissues produced the quality of DNA suitable for WGS. As a negative control, DNA samples were also obtained from normal human liver tissues (Columbia University Pathology, New York, NY, USA) and sent in parallel for the same WGS-metagenomics analyses. The Illumina WGS method produced over 186 million DNA sequencing reads (100 base long each), which contained both human and non-human sequences. Reads were aligned to human / reference GRCh37 with the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA), V 0.6.2. (Bio-bwa.sourceforge.net, http: // bio-bwa.sourceforge.net). The resulting alignment files (bam) were filtered using Samtools (Htslib.org, http: // www.htslib.org) to remove reads that mapped to the human reference.

Infiltrating CD3 + T Lymphocytes
As described above, positive immunostaining for CD3 lymphocytes was found in all four organs in the initial histopathology analyses. To follow up on this observation, we asked whether the presence of B. burgdorferi biofilm correlated spatially to the distribution of CD3 + lymphocytes, indicating potential local tissue inflammation next to B. burgdorferi biofilms. Therefore, in the next set of experiments, we analyzed B. burgdorferi / alginate-positive tissue sections for infiltrating CD3 + T lymphocytes from the four organs. First, we identified sections with positive immunostaining for Borrelia (Figure 9, Panels A, E, I, and M; green staining) and alginate (Figure 9, Panels B, F, J, and N; red staining) using IHC procedures as described above to depict biofilm structures. In good agreement with the previous IHC experiments, a nonspecific IgG isotype control was used as a negative control (Figure 9, Panels C, G, K, and O). After finding a biofilm, the adjacent slides were stained with a CD3 antibody. While heart tissues did not reveal any CD3 + cells (Figure 9, Panel H), brain, kidney, and liver tissues demonstrated aggregates of CD3 + lymphocytes surrounding the B. burgdorferi biofilms (Figure 9, Panels D, L, and P), but not the adjacent tissues. Interestingly, the size of the biofilm did not correlate with the severity of lymphocytic inflammation, as a very small biofilm aggregate in kidney tissue was associated with a marked lymphocytic response (Figure 9, Panel L), while a larger biofilm structure in the liver resulted in a more localized CD3 staining pattern (Figure 9, Panel P).

In this study, we asked if there was evidence of B. burgdorferi in  a  Lyme disease patient who received extensive antibiotic treatment during the course of her 16-year-long illness. Despite this long treatment  protocol,  the  patient  experienced  recurrent  symptoms  of  Lyme  disease,  including neurologic deterioration, joint pain, and severe worsening of pulmonary function, and eventually died  [11,47 -49].  Examination  of  her  liver,  heart,  kidney,  and  brain  tissues  revealed  significant pathological  changes  and  also  provided  several  lines  of  evidence  for  the  presence  of Borrelia antigen/DNA in all of the tissues studied. To prove the presence of B. burgdorferi DNA, in addition to FISH and standard PCR, we employed an independent verification approach using WGS/metagenomics, which revealed significant amounts of B. burgdorferi -specific DNA sequences in liver tissues. Furthermore, IHC, FISH, and confocal microscopy revealed not only spirochetes, but In this study, we asked if there was evidence of B. burgdorferi in a Lyme disease patient who received extensive antibiotic treatment during the course of her 16-year-long illness.

Borrelia
Antigens and DNA Are Associated with Biofilms
Thepresence of large numbers of B. burgdorferi -positive structures, as well the long-term persistence of the symptoms of Lyme disease, suggests an antibiotic-refractory chronic disease. One hypothesis for persistence is that di GLYPH<11> erent morphological forms of Borrelia may protect the bacteria from antibacterial therapy, since B. burgdorferi can exist in spirochetal, round body, and biofilm forms [29,30,41-43].
Our results support this hypothesis, showing that Borrelia is mainly present in the biofilm form in each organ. The B. burgdorferi aggregates contained the well-established biofilm marker alginate, suggesting they are true biofilms. Biofilms are aggregations of loose planktonic microorganisms that attach to biotic and abiotic surfaces and provide protection to individual cells against unfavorable environmental conditions such as pH, temperature, free radicals, antibiotics, and antimicrobials, as well as high concentrations of oxygen [33,34]. These resistant aggregations grow through continuous spreading by detaching and seeding onto surrounding surfaces, causing chronic infections [35-37]. In the human body, biofilm formations by pathogenic species are one of the main reasons for developing chronic diseases [37]. Biofilms are ubiquitous in normal and pathogenic human processes and they provide homeostasis in various hostile environments [33]. They are held together and protected by a barrier known as extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), consisting of proteins, nucleic acids, extracellular DNA, polysaccharides including alginate, various lectins, and glucosamines [34,41,42]. The role of the EPS layer is to protect the bacteria from a hostile environment and also enhance its adhesion to solid surfaces [34].","antibiotics-08-00183.pdf","{""3.2.

Borrelia Antigens and DNA Are Associated with Biofilms
Several chronic infections have been associated with biofilms, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa , associated with cystic fibrosis, keratitis from contact lenses, urinary tract infections from Escherichia coli , osteomyelitis or endocarditis by Staphylococcus aureus , and pulmonary infections from Streptococcus pneumoniae . [52-56]. The presence of biofilms in these conditions can a GLYPH<11> ect host cellular function and can lead to inflammation and tissue damage [56,57].
The existence of B. burgdorferi biofilm was proven both in vitro and in vivo in borrelial lymphocytoma skin lesions [41-43]. Biofilm markers such as alginate and lectins, the key components of the EPS layer in other biofilm-forming bacteria, were also found in Borrelia biofilms [41-43].
Similar to the P. aeruginosa biofilm, the B. burgdorferi biofilm also forms to protect individual spirochetes from the immune system and from antimicrobial agents. Biofilm infections are well known to be resistant to antibiotics [58]. We have previously shown that certain antibiotics, such as doxycycline, which are very e GLYPH<11> ective against spirochetes, cannot eliminate the B. burgdorferi biofilm, which may even increase in size upon antibiotic exposure [44-46].

Another hypothesis is an extended immune response created by the continued presence of antigenic debris or immunogenic peptidoglycans shed from B. burgdorferi [59,60]. However, the fact that this patient was treated extensively during an illness of 16 years argues against that idea, and it is unlikely that debris could persist for that period of time.

Borrelia DNAPersists in the Long Term
Nucleic acids are excellent analytic tools for direct diagnostic tests since DNA RNA can be / quickly cleared from the human body [62,63]. In a mouse study in which heat-killed B. burgdorferi was injected under the skin of mice, borrelial DNA became virtually undetectable after 8 h [64]; the same study showed that no B. burgdorferi genomic materials can be detected in the skin, ear, ankle, or heart tissues of mice receiving killed bacteria two and four weeks after injection. Furthermore, in a ceftriaxone-treated mouse model that investigated the persistence of non-cultivable B. burgdorferi by monitoring the pathogen DNA level for 12 months, the Borrelia DNAlevel initially cleared after ceftriaxone treatment but resurfaced after 12 months, suggesting persistent infection [17,23]. In another non-human primate study, viable B. burgdorferi were recovered by xenodiagnoses and in vivo cultures from both antibiotic-treated and untreated rhesus macaques infected with B. burgdorferi [20,21]. Furthermore, intact spirochetes were observed in the brain and heart of B. burgdorferi -infected rhesus macaques 8-9 months after antibiotic treatment [22]. Several human studies also suggested that the chronic form of Lyme disease could be caused by a persistent spirochetal infection [25-28]. Our data

Long-Term Infection Is Associated with Multi-Organ Pathology
Wefoundpathology in the CNS, PNS, liver, kidney, and heart. Much of the pathology appears to be hypoxic ischemic in nature. Thus, there was extensive fibrous scarring in the cardiac muscle and kidney. / The CNS contained infarcts of acute, subacute, and chronic pathology. We found occluded blood vessels, although there was no acute vasculitis, and widespread perivascular inflammation. There was a small focus on inflammation in one nerve root. The nervous system pathology of meningo-occlusive vascular disease, parenchymal infarcts, and perivascular mononuclear inflammation is consistent with previous reports. Mononuclear, perivascular infiltrates were present in the meninges and brain and cord parenchyma of a patient with a subacute course [65], and chronic meningitis with occlusive meningovascular disease and parenchymal infarcts in a patient with a three-year course [66]. In the latter report, the authors found images consistent with spirochetes with the Warthin-Starry stain. In one autopsy and two biopsies of patients with CNS Lyme, Oksi et al. reported perivascular inflammation and, in the autopsy, subcortical demyelination [67]. Either CSF or brain tissue, or both, was positive for B. burgdorferi DNAby PCR. Other reports describe clinical and radiographic evidence for vasculitis and stroke [68,69], as reviewed in Miklossy [70].

T-Cell Inflammation Is Associated with Biofilm
The immune response against planktonic bacteria is very well studied for many di GLYPH<11> erent bacteria, including B. burgdorferi [71], but considerably less is known about the immune response to pathogenic biofilm [72]. Our positive IHC data for the presence of infiltrating T cells next to Borrelia aggregates suggest a connection between B. burgdorferi biofilm and the host inflammatory response and raise the question of what attracted the lymphocytes to the site of the biofilm. Interestingly, it is not necessarily B. burgdorferi antigens, as recent studies have shown that the EPS components of biofilm such as alginate can have strong antigenicity [73]. In a pulmonary disease study, patients with P. aeruginosa infection had high levels of anti-alginate antibody titers in their sera, with positive connection to the severity of the disease [73]. In another study, infected subcutaneous wounds of rabbits with P. aeruginosa led to delayed wound healing and a massive inflammatory response [74]. Their findings of extensive amounts of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) in those infected wounds led to the investigation of the role of EPS in the pathogenic process. In a follow-up study, they showed that wounds infected with EPS-deficient P. aeruginosa mutants had shorter healing times with less inflammation, while biofilm structures were still found in wounds, suggesting the importance of EPS in inflammatory processes [75]. In a study conducted to investigate how breast implants with bacterial biofilms lead to an increase in infiltrating T lymphocytes, implants were inserted into pigs and inoculated with a human pathogen, Staphylococcus epidermis , a biofilm-forming bacterium [76]. IHC staining of the infected implants showed high number of biofilm structures with surrounding CD3 + lymphocytes [76].

in the brain, kidney, and liver. We are in the process of further analyzing additional inflammatory markers in those tissues to better understand the connection of Borrelia biofilm with the host response. We are also reanalyzing our (WGS) metagenomics sequencing reads for additional potential pathogens in her tissues to evaluate / whether (an)other infection agent(s) could have contributed to her disease.
One of the obvious limitations of this study is that it investigated the potential presence of B. burgdorferi in several main organs of one Lyme disease patient, not multiple patients. This patient, however, is unique because she was the first reported, culture-confirmed treatment failure patient in the United States [11]. The fact that we have available autopsy tissues from major organs from this case is extremely rare, and we are not aware of the existence of multiple autopsy tissues from any
other well-documented Lyme disease case to date. Furthermore, our research group consisted of the primary physician (KBL) and the two case pathologists (JEG and JL), who had detailed knowledge of this case. Our study, however, clearly shows the urgent need for established biobanks for human biopsy and autopsy tissues from Lyme disease patients. Without those research materials, we will not able to perform fundamental studies to develop a better understanding of B. burgdorferi infection and the progression of Lyme disease in the human body.
In summary, we provide evidence of B. burgdorferi -specific antigens and DNA in the liver, heart, kidney, and brain from a well-documented Lyme disease patient who received extensive antibiotic treatment during the course of her 16-year-long illness. Findings from this study suggest that B. burgdorferi can persist in the human body in biofilm form even after long-term antibiotic treatment.","antibiotics-08-00183.pdf","{""3.5.

Autopsy Tissue Procurement and Processing
An autopsy was performed five days postmortem at Columbia University Medical Center. After formalin fixation, organs were sectioned and tissues embedded in para GLYPH<14> n. The brain was sectioned coronally, and the brain stem and cord transversely. Multiple sections were taken from the cortex and white matter of the hemispheres, basal ganglia, thalamus, brain stem, and spinal cord, embedded in para GLYPH<14> n. All tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, the CNS additionally with Luxol fast blue for myelin and Bielschowsky silver stain for axons at the Columbia University Medical Center. All tissues were also immunostained with antibodies to CD3 and CD20 using Columbia University Medical Center Pathology services.
Para GLYPH<14> n-embedded brain, heart, kidney, and liver sections and non-infected human autopsy tissue sections (4 µ m) were forwarded to the University of New Haven's Lyme Disease Research Laboratory after receiving approval from the Institutional Review Board of the University of New Haven.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
The para GLYPH<14> n sections of the four organs (brain, heart, kidney, and liver) were subjected to two di GLYPH<11> erent IHC procedures, both validated and described previously [43,47]. One of the IHC procedures was designed to add the B. burgdorferi and alginate antibodies to the same tissue slide, and in the other IHC procedure the alginate antibody was added to a sequential tissue section, as described previously [43]. The only di GLYPH<11> erence from the published protocol was that we used two di GLYPH<11> erently labeled secondary antibodies for the alginate primary antibody. It was either labeled with a fluorescent red tag (goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L), DyLight 594 conjugated) for the IHC experiments or a fluorescent blue tag (goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L), DyLight 405 conjugated) for the FISH and confocal microscopy analyses.
As negative controls, human brain, heart, kidney, and liver para GLYPH<14> n tissue sections from a patient of the same age and gender with no neurological signs or symptoms and no neuropathological changes were stained following the same procedure as above. Additional negative controls included commercially available human brain, kidney, heart, and liver tissue sections (20 each, US Biomax, Rockville, MD, USA) were also included. Non-specific isotype IgG controls (IgG1 Isotype Control, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA MA1-10406) were used instead of the primary antibodies as IHC negative controls.
For independent confirmation, brain tissue sections were sent to Innsbruck Medical University and immunostained with a B. burgdorferi -specific antibody to confirm the presence of Borrelia spp. utilizing the Ventana-KIT (Ventana Medical Systems, Munich, Germany), as described previously [50].","antibiotics-08-00183.pdf","{""4.2.

Genomic DNAs were extracted from para GLYPH<14> n-embedded tissues using a Qiagen QIAamp DNA formalin-fixed, para GLYPH<14> n-embedded (FFPE) tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). First, the slides were depara GLYPH<14> nized as described above and tissues present on the slides were scraped o GLYPH<11> using sterile blades and collected in sterile microcentrifuge tubes. Then 180 µ L of ATL bu GLYPH<11> er and 20 µ L of proteinase K were added to the tubes and the samples were incubated overnight at 42 GLYPH<14> C and then at 90 GLYPH<14> C for 1 h to deactivate the enzyme. Next 200 µ L of AL bu GLYPH<11> er and an additional 200 µ L of 96% ethanol were added to the samples and vortexed thoroughly. The samples were then transferred to DNeasy mini columns and centrifuged for one minute at 6000x g. The flow-through was discarded and the columns were placed into new collection tubes. To wash away any unwanted materials that might be present along with the DNA, 500 µ L of AW1 and AW2 bu GLYPH<11> ers were added to the columns consecutively and centrifuged at 6000x g for 1 min. The spin columns were then placed in fresh collection tubes and centrifuged at 20,000x g for 3 min to dry the columns completely. The columns were then placed in new microcentrifuge tubes and the samples were eluted twice with 50 µ L of ATE bu GLYPH<11> er each step. / The DNA samples were quantified using a BioTek (Winooski, VT, USA) Microplate Spectrophotometer.

Whole-Genome Sequencing Metagenomic Analyses /
DNAsamples were first evaluated using an eGel and PicoGreen fluorometry at PerkinElmer DNA Sequencing and Analyzing Services to measure the quality and quantity, respectively. DNA samples were then physically sheared to the desired size (300-1000 bp) using a Covaris (Woburn, MA, USA). E220 focused ultrasonicator. Whole-genome libraries were prepared using an Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) TruSeq kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Whole-genome sequencing was performed using an Illumina HiSeq2500 instrument. Raw sequencing data were converted to FASTQ format using Illumina's BCL2FASTQ v. 1.82. Reads were aligned to human reference GRCh37 with the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA), v. 0.6.2. (http: // bio-bwa.sourceforge.net). The resulting alignment files (bam) were filtered using Samtools (http: // www.htslib.org) to remove reads that mapped to the human reference. The remaining reads were then filtered to remove low-quality reads using Trimmomatic (http: // www.usadellab.org cms ?page / / = trimmomatic). The remaining high-quality reads were then mapped, using BWA, against various bacterial reference genomes of interest.

Conclusions
In summary, this study provides several lines of evidence that Borrelia can persist in the human body not only in the spirochetal but also in the antibiotic-resistant biofilm form, even after long-term antibiotic treatment. The presence of infiltrating lymphocytes in the vicinity of B. burgdorferi biofilms suggests that the biofilm might trigger chronic inflammatory responses.

In  2015,  we  founded Pedi Lyme Net, a pediatric Lyme disease research network comprising 8 emergency de -partments in the United States. Of 2,497 children evalu -ated at 1 of these sites for Lyme disease, 515 (20.6%) were  infected.

Lyme Disease Biobank, United States, 2015-2020
C hildren  are  disproportionally  affected  by  Lyme disease,  which  is  diagnosed  in ≈ 300,000  persons in the United States each year ( 1 ). Clinicians diagnose Lyme  disease  using  a  2-tier  examination  of  enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and immunoblot results. Current Lyme disease diagnostic tests have well-described limitations that include false negatives early in disease ( 3 ) and inability to distinguish between resolved, active, and recurrent infections ( 4 ). Clinicians must also wait several days for Lyme disease serologic results, a delay that might contribute to late or unnecessary treatment with antimicrobial drugs. The increased incidence of Lyme disease, limitations of current tests, and lack of studies in children demonstrate the need for a systematic approach to Lyme disease diagnosis in children.
Developing improved diagnostic techniques relies on  biobanks  of  samples  collected  from  patients  with Lyme  disease  and  clinical  mimics  (i.e.,  patients  with similar  signs  and  symptoms caused by non-Lyme illnesses). The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA) curated the first Lyme disease biobank with samples from 86 adults with Lyme dis -ease, 144 clinical mimics, and 203 healthy controls from 11 collection sites ( 5 ). The Study of Lyme Disease Immunology and Clinical Events (http://www.slicestudies. org) at the Johns Hopkins Lyme Disease Research Cen -ter  (Baltimore,  MD,  USA)  enrolled  40  adults  with  an erythema migrans (EM) lesion and followed up with patients  for  1  year.

We describe enrolled children 1-21 years of age who  underwent  emergency  department  evaluation for Lyme disease during June 1, 2015-January 31, 2020 (Table). We obtained informed consent from parents/ guardians for study participation and child assent for those >8 years of age. Informed consent documents were available  in  English  and  Spanish.  We  defined disease  stage  on  the  basis  of  signs  and  symptoms: early (i.e., single EM lesion), early disseminated (i.e., multiple EM lesions, cranial neuritis,  meningitis,  or carditis) or late (i.e., arthritis or arthralgia). In addition, as asymptomatic controls, we enrolled children undergoing intravenous cannulation  for  procedural sedation  for  fracture  reduction  or  laceration  repair without acute infectious symptoms. We implemented standard operating procedures at each of the participating sites (Appendix Table). All deidentified data were collected electronically with Research Electronic Data Capture housed at Harvard University (https:// catalyst.harvard.edu/services/redcap).
We defined Lyme disease on the basis of an EM lesion diagnosed by the treating clinician or positive serologic results with compatible symptoms. We took serum  samples  from  all  enrolled  patients,  including asymptomatic controls, and conducted a C6 EIA on each sample. If the EIA results were positive or equivocal, we also conducted a Western immunoblot interpreted  using  standard  criteria  ( 8 ).  We  considered a positive IgM immunoblot paired with a negative IgG immunoblot to be positive only if symptoms lasted <30 days ( 10 ). We classified symptomatic chil -dren who tested negative for Lyme disease as clinical mimics.

We  enrolled  and  obtained  samples  from  2,497 symptomatic and 377 asymptomatic control patients (Appendix  Figure  2).  Overall,  515  (20.6%  of  symptomatic patients) had Lyme disease; of these children, 46 (8.9%) had an EM lesion alone, 461 (89.5%) had a positive 2-tier serology alone, and 8 (1.6%) had both. Of  the  asymptomatic  control  patients,  4  (1.1%)  had positive 2-tier serology.
Our Pediatric Lyme Disease Biobank is unique be -cause it  includes  biosamples from pediatric patients, clinical  mimics,  and  diverse  geographic regions. The samples are linked to demographic, clinical, laborato -ry, and treatment data about each patient. With >2,800 children enrolled, this biobank is a unique resource for researching Lyme disease diagnosis in children.
Our biobank has a few limitations. First, we en -rolled  a  convenience  sample  of  children  depending on  the  availability  of  study  staff.  However,  in  this study, the proportion of children with Lyme disease did not differ between enrolled and unenrolled but eligible  patients.  Second,  some  children  with  early or early-disseminated Lyme disease might have had false  negative  serologic  results.  However,  we  conducted  follow-up  to  identify  children  who  had  initially negative 2-tier Lyme serologic results but tested positive  within  30  days  of  enrollment.

Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Maine CDC) annually publishes a report on infectious diseases in Maine. This report is prepared by the Division of Disease Surveillance and is intended to provide an overview of notifiable infectious diseases of public health importance in Maine.
We could not produce this report without the continued support of our healthcare and public health partners throughout the state. We greatly appreciate all of the laboratories, healthcare providers, childcare centers, school nurses, veterinarians, and others who provide disease surveillance information. Partners spend considerable time assisting Maine CDC with infectious disease investigations and disease control measures that affect Maine residents. Public health partners' active and critical role in the infectious disease surveillance cycle informs statewide policies and programs that protect our residents from infectious diseases through health promotion, disease prevention, early detection, containment, and treatment.
We appreciate and encourage your vigilance in the effort to protect the people of Maine through timely, complete, and accurate notifiable infectious disease reporting. It is through these collaborative efforts that we are able to respond to emerging infectious disease threats and prevent outbreaks.
We hope you find this report useful as we all work to protect and promote the health of Maine's residents. As always, we welcome your feedback on how we can provide more useful disease information to you, our partners.
For more information on what, when, and how to report infectious diseases please see the Notifiable Diseases and Conditions List (Page 73) of this report, visit our website at www.maine.gov/idepi or call 1-800-821-5821.
