:
Babesiosis is a potentially severe tickborne disease transmitted through the bite of an infected deer tick ( Ixodes scapularis ). Signs of babesiosis usually range from no symptoms (asymptomatic) to serious disease. Common symptoms include extreme fatigue, aches, fever, chills, sweating, dark urine, and possibly anemia. People who are infected generally make a full recovery as long as they have a healthy spleen and do not have other diseases that prevent them from fighting off infections. Preliminary data as of January 16, 2017 showed 117 cases of babesiosis reported in 2017, which is an increase from the 82 cases in 2016.

miyamotoi :
Borrelia miyamotoi is a species of spiral-shaped bacteria that is closely related to the bacteria that causes tickborne relapsing fever (TBRF).  It is more distantly related to the bacteria that causes Lyme disease.  First identified in 1995 in ticks from Japan, B. miyamotoi has now been detected in two species of North American ticks, the black-legged or 'deer' tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) and the western black-legged tick ( Ixodes pacificus ).  Individuals with this infection are likely to have fever, chills, and headache.  Other common symptoms include joint pain and fatigue.  Unlike Lyme disease, rash is uncommon.  Although Borrelia miyamotoi is not nationally notifiable, federal CDC in association with endemic states developed a standardized case classification to help standardize reporting and understand the prevalence in the United States.

:
Ehrlichiosis is a disease caused by the bacteria Ehrlichia chaffeensis which infects white blood cells (monocytes). Ehrlichia was previously known as human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME). Signs and symptoms of ehrlichiosis include: fever, headache, nausea, and body aches. Encephalitis/ meningitis may occur. Ehrlichiosis is transmitted to a person through the bite of an infected lone star tick ( Amblyomma americanum ). Ehrlichiosis is uncommon in Maine as the tick is not commonly found here.  However, this may be a disease to watch for as the tick appears to be moving north. Preliminary data as of January 16, 2017 showed ten probable cases of Ehrlichia chaffensis reported in 2017 from Androscoggin, Cumberland, Kennebec, Somerset, and York counties. Maine had ten probable cases of Ehrlichia/Anaplasma Undetermined in 2017, which occurs when serologies are done, but titers are the same for both Ehrlichia and Anaplasma so we cannot tell which organism was present.

Powassan is a virus transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected woodchuck tick ( Ixodes cookei ) or deer tick ( Ixodes scapularis ). It is the only tickborne arbovirus occurring in the United States and Canada.  Approximately 100 cases of Powassan were reported in the United States in the last decade, and cases appear to be increasing.  Signs and symptoms of Powassan include fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, seizures, and memory loss.  Long-term neurologic problems may occur.  There were three reported cases of Powassan in Maine in 2017. One case was reported in Cumberland county and two cases were reported in Knox county.

Fever Rickettsiosis:
Spotted Fever Rickettsioses (SFR) are a group of bacterial illnesses, the most common of which is Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF).  Signs and symptoms of RMSF include fever, chills, headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, and a maculopapular rash often on the palms and the soles. RMSF is transmitted to a person through the bite of an infected dog tick ( Dermacentor variabilis ). RMSF is not known to be endemic in Maine, but could become an emerging disease.

Emerging Tickborne Diseases:
Federal CDC and other researchers are continually on the watch for new or emerging tickborne disease.  Pathogens identified in the last few years include Heartland virus, and Bourbon virus. Maine has no documented cases of any of these diseases, but there is serological evidence (from either humans or wild animals) of Heartland virus in Maine, so these are diseases to watch.

Lyme disease is diagnosed clinically with the aid of laboratory testing. An erythema migrans in an endemic area is sufficiently distinctive to allow clinical diagnosis in the absence of laboratory confirmation.  Patients should be treated on the basis of clinical findings.  A two tier testing algorithm is recommended for laboratory testing. First-tier testing is most often an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test which, if positive or equivocal, should be followed by an IgM and IgG Immunoblot.  IgM is only considered reliable if tested within the first 30 days after symptom onset. Acute and convalescent testing is useful to determine final diagnosis.  Untreated patients who remain seronegative despite having symptoms for 6-8 weeks are unlikely to have Lyme disease, and other potential diagnoses should be actively pursued.  A diagnosis of Lyme disease made by a clinician may or may not meet the federal surveillance case definition, and therefore may not always be counted as a case.  Maine CDC refers physicians with questions about diagnosis to the IDSA guidelines https://www.idsociety.org/uploadedfiles/idsa/guidelines-patient_care/pdf_library/lyme%20disease.pdf
During 2009 and 2010, IDSA convened a special review of the clinical practice guidelines on Lyme disease to determine whether the 2006 guidelines should be revised and updated.

The special panel reviewed the medical and scientific literature as well as material submitted by the 18 individuals who testified at the hearing and about 150 other comments submitted by the public. The panel also heard from several representatives of the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS), who argued for more extensive treatment for what ILADS identifies as chronic Lyme disease.  The panel met 16 times and the review took more than a year to complete. On April 22, 2010 the special Review Panel 'unanimously agreed that no changes need be made to the 2006 Lyme disease treatment guidelines developed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)' (https://www.idsociety.org/uploadedfiles/idsa/guidelines-patient_care/pdf_library/lyme%20disease.pdf).
'The Review Panel concurred that all of the recommendations from the 2006 guidelines are medically and scientifically justified in light of the evidence and information provided, including the recommendations that are most contentious: that there is no convincing evidence for the existence of
chronic Lyme infection; and that long-term antibiotic treatment of 'chronic Lyme disease' is unproven and unwarranted.  This recommendation is also supported by federal CDC.  Inappropriate use of antibiotics (especially given intravenously) has been shown to lead to deadly blood infections, serious drug reactions and C. difficile diarrhea, as well as the creation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria or 'superbugs.''

The education, training, and guidance provided by Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention to health care professionals on the current methods of diagnosing and treating Lyme disease and other tickborne illnesses
Maine CDC continues to emphasize prevention and control of Lyme disease.  Surveillance for tickborne diseases, including Lyme disease, is performed by the Division of Disease Control, Infectious Disease Program, as Lyme disease is a notifiable disease entity by both medical practitioners and clinical laboratories.  Reporting clinicians must submit subsequent clinical and laboratory information following the initial report.  Maine CDC also monitors tickborne diseases through syndromic surveillance.  By querying of participating hospital emergency department (ED) patient visit data, patients that complain of a tick bite are identified.  An increase in ED visits for tick bites is usually a precursor for the typical seasonal increase in Lyme disease incidence.  A comparison of 2016 and 2017 data is included as Appendix 5. Maine CDC partners with the University of Maine Cooperative Extension Office to monitor the identification of deer ticks in Maine through a passive submission system.
A spatial analysis of 2017 Lyme disease surveillance data was performed at the county level, showing the continual disease progression (Appendix 6).  Outreach and education to clinicians and other healthcare providers to increase provider response to required supplemental clinical and laboratory information is ongoing.
Maine CDC epidemiologists provide consultation to the medical community on tickborne diseases, offering educational and preventive information as needed.

 The education and public awareness activities conducted by Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention for the prevention of Lyme disease and other tickborne illnesses
Maine CDC promotes ongoing educational outreach activities targeting the public and Maine municipalities.  During 2017, Maine CDC epidemiologists provided consultation to the public on tickborne diseases, offering educational and preventive information as needed.  Maine CDC epidemiologists present educational outreach activities and seminars on tickborne disease prevention to the general public including:
· 36 presentations or displays held for: students in 3 rd -8 th grade, Boy Scouts of America, public works employees, forestry department summer workers, health and physical education teachers, mill workers, health care providers, Department of Transportation staff, seniors, and the general public.
· Numerous media interviews given by Maine CDC employees (vectorborne epidemiologist, state health officer, and state epidemiologist).
Maine CDC's Vectorborne Epidemiologist chairs the State Vectorborne Disease Work Group ; a group comprised of both State agencies and private entities, which meets on a bimonthly basis to proactively address surveillance, prevention and control strategies.  Members of this group include: Maine Department of Health and Human Services, Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry, Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, Maine Department of Education, Maine Department of Environmental Protection, Maine Forest Service, University of Maine Cooperative Extension Services, and the United States Department of Agriculture. A full list of members can be found in Appendix 7. Educational efforts by the Vectorborne Work Group included:
· Presentations given on ticks and Lyme disease

 The education and public awareness activities conducted by Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention for the prevention of Lyme disease and other tickborne illnesses
In 2014, Maine CDC began a project with students in 3 rd to 5 th grade to teach them about tick biology and ecology , as well as present information on tickborne diseases and prevention. In 2017 Maine CDC expanded the program to include curriculum and activities developed for middle schools. The program consists of a pre-test to gauge knowledge prior to the intervention; a twenty minute PowerPoint presentation on tick biology and ecology, as well as disease information;  four ten-minute interactive activities; a take-home packet with games, activities, and information for parents; and a post-test to determine changes in knowledge and practices. This was undertaken with the Maine Public Health Corps (PHC) students who designed the curriculum and assisted with the activities. An epidemiologist or PHC member presented the disease and biology/ecology information. Participants evaluated the program highly in all schools. This endeavor is being undertaken in close partnership with the Maine Department of Education.  An example of one of the newly developed middle school activities can be found in Appendix 8.
Educational materials for the 3 rd -5 th and 6 th -8 th graders are available online, including our educator's guide, group activities, and activity book for both ticks and mosquitoes.

 The education and public awareness activities conducted by Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention for the prevention of Lyme disease and other tickborne illnesses
In 2017, Maine CDC and PHC expanded the Tick Free ME program which educates adults ages 45 years and older about ticks and tick prevention practices. In 2017 Maine CDC conducted the Tick Free ME program entirely online.  The program consisted of a questionnaire administered prior to participation to gauge prior knowledge and tick prevention behaviors and to gather contact information. During the challenge month participants received fact sheets on tickborne diseases in Maine (Lyme disease, Anaplasma , Babesia, and Powassan ), repellent, and other tick prevention methods, and videos about tick habitats, diseases, and prevention. PHC members used weekly surveys to measure participant's prevention behaviors each week.
Maine CDC and PHC maintains a series of instructional short videos to educate the Maine community in tick prevention and tickborne diseases. These videos include:

The four winning posters and two honorable mentions are available for viewing at the Lyme disease website www.maine.gov/lyme.

 The education and public awareness activities conducted by Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention for the prevention of Lyme disease and other tickborne illnesses
In 2011 Maine CDC launched Lyme disease data on the Maine Tracking Network Portal .  The data portal allows users to customize their data inquiries and includes data from 2001-2016, including town level data.  The Lyme portion of the portal was accessed 3,159 times during 2017.  The Maine Tracking Network Lyme Data are available on Maine CDC's website at www.maine.gov/idepi. Please see Appendix 12 for a sample table and map. Data can be broken down by:
· Public Health District
· Town
· County
· Gender
· Age group
Maine CDC's main prevention message is encouraging Maine residents and visitors to use personal protective measures to prevent tick exposures. Personal protective measures include avoiding tick habitat, use of EPA approved repellents, wearing long sleeves and pants, and daily tick checks and tick removal after being in tick habitats (ticks must be attached >24 hours to transmit Lyme disease). Persons who have been in tick habitats should consult a medical provider if they have unexplained rashes, fever, or other unusual illnesses during the first several months after exposure. Possible community approaches to prevent Lyme disease include landscape management and control of deer herd populations.
VI. A summary of laws of other states enacted during the past year related to the diagnosis, treatment, and insurance coverage for Lyme disease and other tickborne illnesses based on resources made available by federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or Other Organizations

to Maine Legislature - Lyme Disease
During the first special session of the 123 rd Legislature in 2008, hearings and discussion over proposed legislation regarding the reporting of Lyme disease led to Chapter 561 of the Session Laws. This law, An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Insurance and Financial Services Regarding Reporting on Lyme Disease and Other Tickborne Illnesses, directed Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention to submit an annual report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over health and human services matters and the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over health insurance matters.  This report was to include recommendations for legislation to address public health programs for the prevention and treatment of Lyme disease and other tickborne illnesses in the state, as well as to address a review and evaluation of Lyme disease and other tickborne illnesses in Maine.
A bill in the second session of the 124 th Legislature in 2010 amended these laws to include information on diagnosis of Lyme disease.

The best way to prevent POW virus disease is by protecting yourself from tick bites.
· Avoid contact with ticks by avoiding wooded and bushy areas with high grass.
· Apply repellents to bare skin, according to label instructions.
o Repellents containing DEET can be applied to exposed skin, but only last a few hours.
o Clothing and gear can be treated with permethrin, which remains protective through several washings.
· Find and remove ticks before they have a chance to bite and attach.

Summary
Lyme disease is a notifiable condition in the State of Maine.  The goal of Lyme disease surveillance is to help define demographic, geographic, and seasonal distribution; monitor disease trends; identify risk factors for transmission; and promote prevention and education efforts among the public and medical communities.  Reported cases are classified as confirmed, probable, and suspect based on clinical symptoms and laboratory testing interpreted using criteria established by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists.  The surveillance case definition is not intended to be used in clinical diagnosis.  Lyme disease surveillance is passive, dependent upon reporting, and therefore likely to be an under-representation of the true burden of Lyme disease in Maine.

Directions :
Choose 1 student to be the disease (tagger), and 1 student to be the antibodies (unfreezers); the rest of the students will be cells. The taggers will run around to tag the cells, and if a cell is tagged, then they sit down and wait for an antibody (unfreezer) to come rescue them. The antibodies carry around a list of questions to ask the tagged cells. If the infected cells answer correctly, then they join the antibodies in a conga line to help the other cells. If they answer incorrectly, then they join the disease (taggers) and try to tag other cells. In the end, when there are no more cells, whichever team (disease or antibody) has the most people, wins. Multiple rounds can be played as time allows. Select new students to be the tagger and unfreezer.

  Lyme disease
Lyme disease is caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi which is transmitted to a person through the bite of an infected deer tick (Ixodes scapularis ). Symptoms of Lyme disease include the formation of a characteristic expanding rash (erythema migrans) at the site of a tick bite 3-30 days after exposure. Fever, headache, joint and muscle pains, and fatigue are also common during the first several weeks. Later features of Lyme disease can include arthritis in one or more joints (often the knee), Bell's palsy and other cranial nerve palsies, meningitis, and carditis (AV block). Lyme disease is rarely fatal.  The great majority of Lyme disease cases can be treated very effectively with oral antibiotics for ten days to a few weeks. IV antibiotics for up to 28 days may be needed for some cases of Lyme disease which affect the nervous system, joints, or heart.
In the United States, the highest rates of Lyme disease occur across the eastern seaboard (Maryland to Maine) and in the upper Midwest (northern Wisconsin and southern Minnesota), with the onset of most cases occurring during the summer months. In endemic areas, deer ticks are most abundant in wooded, grassy, and brushy areas ('tick habitat'), especially where deer populations are large.
Many endemic states are no longer counting cases of Lyme disease as the burden is too high on the health department.  This affects the national and regional rates as the number of cases appears to drop, but in reality, it is because these health departments are using a system to estimate the number of cases, rather than trying to count each individual case.  As of 2017, Maine is still counting individual cases but as the burden continues to increase, and funding is limited, Maine will likely transition to an estimation system in the future.

  Lyme disease
The first documented case of Maine-acquired Lyme disease was diagnosed in 1986. The current 2017 numbers are an increase from previous years and will continue to rise as more reports are returned to Maine CDC.  In the 1990's the great majority of Lyme disease cases occurred among residents of south coastal Maine, principally in York County. Disease incidence remains high in the southern and the Mid-Coast areas but is starting to increase in the northern and western counties as well, making the problem statewide. Androscoggin, Aroostook, Franklin, Hancock, Kennebec, Knox, Oxford, Penobscot, Piscataquis, Somerset, Waldo, and Washington counties rates increased from 2016 to 2017. Seven counties have rates of Lyme disease higher than the State rate (Hancock, Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln, Sagadahoc, Somerset, and Waldo).
In 2017 (preliminary data as of January 16, 2017) providers reported 1,769 confirmed and probable cases of Lyme disease among Maine residents, which is a rate of 132.4 cases of Lyme disease per 100,000 persons in Maine.  Twenty-eight percent (28%) of reported cases were from the southern counties (Cumberland and York), and 23% of reported cases were from the Midcoast counties (Knox, Lincoln, Sagadahoc, and Waldo).
Forty-one percent (41%) of cases were female and fifty-nine percent (59%) of cases were male. The median age of cases in 2017 was 53 years of age (average age of 46 years). The age at diagnosis ranged from 1-99 years. Sixty-eight percent (68%) of the cases with a known onset date had onset during June, July, or August (date of onset is missing for 17% of cases).

Anaplasmosis is a disease caused by the bacteria Anaplasma phagocytophilum which infects white blood cells (neutrophils). Anaplasma was previously known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) or human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) but was renamed in 2003 to differentiate between two different organisms that cause similar diseases (Anaplasmosis and Ehrlichiosis). Signs and symptoms of anaplasmosis include: fever, headache, malaise, and body aches. Encephalitis/ meningitis may occur but is rare. Anaplasmosis is transmitted to a person through the bite of an infected deer tick ( Ixodes scapularis ).  Preliminary data as of January 16, 2017 showed 662 cases of anaplasmosis reported in 2017, a 78% increase from the 372 cases in 2016.

to Maine Legislature - Lyme Disease
During the first special session of the 123 rd Legislature in 2008, hearings and discussion over proposed legislation regarding the reporting of Lyme disease led to Chapter 561 of the Session Laws. This law, An Act to Implement the Recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Insurance and Financial Services Regarding Reporting on Lyme Disease and Other Tick Borne Illnesses, directed Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention to submit an annual report to the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over health and human services matters and the joint standing committee of the Legislature having jurisdiction over health insurance matters.

Fever Rickettsiosis:
Spotted Fever Rickettsioses are a group of bacterial illnesses, the most common of which is Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF).  Signs and symptoms of RMSF include fever, chills, headache, gastrointestinal symptoms and a maculopapular rash often on the palms and the soles.  RMSF is transmitted to a person through the bite of an infected dog tick ( Dermacentor variabilis ).  RMSF is not known to be endemic in Maine, but could become an emerging disease.

The Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for Lyme disease recommended by Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention continues to adhere to the strongest science-based source of information for the diagnosis and treatment of any infectious disease of public health significance.  Nationally, the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) is the leader in setting the standard for clinical practice guidelines on Lyme disease and other tick borne illnesses: http://www.idsociety.org/Index.aspx.
Lyme disease is diagnosed clinically with the aid of laboratory testing.  An erythema migrans in an endemic area is sufficiently distinctive to allow clinical diagnosis in the absence of laboratory confirmation.  Patients should be treated on the basis of clinical findings.  A two tier testing algorithm is recommended for laboratory testing.  First-tier testing is most often an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbant assay (ELISA) test, which if positive or equivocal should be followed by an IgM and IgG Immunoblot.  IgM is only considered reliable if tested within the first 30 days after symptom onset. Acute and convalescent testing is useful to determine final diagnosis.  Untreated patients who remain seronegative despite having symptoms for 6-8 weeks are unlikely to have Lyme disease, and other potential diagnoses should be actively pursued.  A diagnosis of Lyme disease made by a clinician may or may not meet the federal surveillance case definition, and therefore may not always be counted as a case.  Maine CDC refers physicians with questions about diagnosis to the IDSA guidelines http://www.idsociety.org/Index.aspx.
During 2009 and 2010, IDSA convened a special review of the clinical practice guidelines on Lyme disease to determine whether the 2006 guidelines should be revised and updated.  A central question explored at the Review Panel hearing held during July 2009 was whether Lyme disease can persist as a chronic infection that can be successfully treated with an extended course of antibiotics.","{""source"": ""test_rag_documents/2014-lyme-legislature.pdf"", ""dl_meta"": {""origin"": {""filename"": ""2014-lyme-legislature.pdf"", ""mimetype"": ""application/pdf"", ""binary_hash"": 8406411723206813536}, ""version"": ""1.0.0"", ""headings"": [""II.

The Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for Lyme disease recommended by Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
The special panel reviewed the medical and scientific literature as well as material submitted by the 18 individuals who testified at the hearing and about 150 other comments submitted by the public. The panel also heard from several representatives of the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS), who argued for more extensive treatment for what ILADS identifies as chronic Lyme disease.  The panel met 16 times and the review took more than a year to complete. On April 22, 2010 the special Review Panel 'unanimously agreed that no changes need be made to the 2006 Lyme disease treatment guidelines developed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)' (http://www.idsociety.org/Index.aspx).
'The Review Panel concurred that all of the recommendations from the 2006 guidelines are medically and scientifically justified in light of the evidence and information provided, including the recommendations that are most contentious: that there is no convincing evidence for the existence of chronic Lyme infection; and that long-term antibiotic treatment of 'chronic Lyme disease' is unproven and unwarranted.  This recommendation is also supported by federal CDC.  Inappropriate use of antibiotics (especially given intravenously) has been shown to lead to deadly blood infections, serious drug reactions and C. difficile diarrhea, as well as the creation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria or 'superbugs.'' (http://www.idsociety.org/Index.aspx).

The Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for Lyme disease recommended by Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) continues to provide leadership in setting the standard for clinical practice guidelines on Lyme disease.  http://www.idsociety.org/Index.aspx.  A bibliography of peer reviewed journal articles published in 2013 as related to these clinical guidelines and other topics of interest is included in Appendix 2.   Maine CDC reviews these journal articles to maintain an understanding of the current research and literature available on Lyme disease clinical management and treatment.
IV. The education, training and guidance provided by Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention to health care professionals on the current methods of diagnosing and treating Lyme disease and other tick borne illnesses
Maine CDC continues to emphasize prevention and control of Lyme disease.  Surveillance for tick borne diseases, including Lyme disease, is performed by the Division of Infectious Disease, as Lyme disease is a notifiable disease entity by both medical practitioners and clinical laboratories.  Reporting clinicians must submit subsequent clinical and laboratory information following the initial report. Maine CDC also monitors tick-borne diseases through syndromic surveillance.  By querying of participating hospital emergency department (ED) patient visit data, patients that complain of a tick bite are identified.  An increase in ED visits for tick bites is usually a precursor for the typical seasonal
increase in Lyme disease incidence.  Maine CDC continues to partner with Maine Medical Center Research Institute to monitor the identification of deer ticks in Maine through a passive submission system.  A map of deer ticks by town of submitter is included in Appendix 3.
During 2013, a spatial analysis of Lyme disease surveillance data was performed at the county level, showing the disease progressing north through the state (Appendix 4).  Outreach and education to clinicians and other healthcare providers to increase provider response to required supplemental clinical and laboratory information is ongoing.","{""source"": ""test_rag_documents/2014-lyme-legislature.pdf"", ""dl_meta"": {""origin"": {""filename"": ""2014-lyme-legislature.pdf"", ""mimetype"": ""application/pdf"", ""binary_hash"": 8406411723206813536}, ""version"": ""1.0.0"", ""headings"": [""II.

The Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for Lyme disease recommended by Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
During 2013, Maine CDC held 8 Lyme Disease Forums for the general public, one in each public health district.  The intent of these forums was to provide an overview of ticks and Lyme disease, discuss prevention methods, and then open the forum up to questions from the audience.  Each forum had a presentation given by an epidemiologist, and then the panel was introduced.  Each district was slightly different, but Maine CDC attempted to have an epidemiologist, biologist, physician, veterinarian, and pesticide expert at each panel.  Participants completed a paper-based questionnaire about their knowledge of ticks and Lyme disease at the end of the forum, and then were invited to complete a second electronic survey after all the forums were complete.  A copy of the electronic survey is included in (Appendix 5).
Maine CDC epidemiologists provide consultation to the medical community on tick borne diseases, offering educational and preventive information as needed.  Maine CDC epidemiologists present educational outreach activities and seminars on tick-borne disease prevention targeting the medical community at statewide meetings of school nurses and others.  Ongoing educational initiatives are featured on the Maine CDC web site:  http://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectiousdisease/epi/vector-borne/lyme/index.shtml.
During 2013, a clinical management guide , 'Physician's Reference Manual: Tick-borne Diseases in Maine, December 2012' was mailed to all emergency rooms, urgent care facilities, infectious disease providers, and pediatricians.  This guide includes information on ticks found in Maine and signs/symptoms, laboratory services, diagnosis, and treatment of six tick-borne diseases, including Lyme disease.

The Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for Lyme disease recommended by Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Maine CDC's State Epidemiologist chairs the State Vector-borne Disease Work Group ; a group comprised of both state agencies and private entities, which meets on a bimonthly basis to proactively address surveillance, prevention and control strategies.  Members of this group include: Maine Department of Human Services, Maine Department of Conservation, Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry, Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, Maine Department of Education and Cultural Services, Maine Veterinary Association, Maine Municipal Association, University of Maine Cooperative Extension Services, United States Department of Agriculture, and Maine Department of Public Safety. A full list of members can be found in Appendix
8. Educational efforts by the Vector-borne Work Group included:
· Presentations given on ticks and Lyme disease.
· Presence at vendor shows, television and radio interviews.
· Distribution of educational materials including Lyme brochures, tick spoons, fact sheets etc.
The Vectorborne Work Group educational sub-committee maintains educational materials for fifth graders on Lyme disease prevention.  Developed materials are available on the website for use by all schools.  A 'Ticks: Know Your Enemy' PowerPoint presentation recorded and narrated by Doug Rafferty is also available online.
· The educational portion of the Lyme disease website was visited 546 times in 2013.
The education subcommittee continues to review and update the materials. This endeavor is being undertaken in close partnership with the Maine Department of Education.

The Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for Lyme disease recommended by Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Another major Lyme Disease Awareness month activity was a statewide poster contest for students in grades K-8.  Students were asked to create a poster with the theme ' Target Lyme ' demonstrating at least one of the four Lyme disease prevention methods (wear protective clothing, use repellent, use caution in tick infested areas, and perform daily tick checks).  Three winning posters were chosen and are available for viewing at the Lyme disease website http://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/vector-borne/lyme/.  One of the winning posters was chosen and turned into a Maine CDC poster (Appendix 10).  This poster was distributed to schools, state parks, board of tourism, and historical sites.
In 2012 Maine CDC launched Lyme disease data on the Maine Tracking Network Portal .  The data portal allows users to customize their data inquiries and includes data from 2001-2012.  Data are broken down by public health district, county, gender, and age group where possible.  Data can be viewed as tables, charts, trend charts, or maps.

The Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for Lyme disease recommended by Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Maine CDC's main prevention message is encouraging Maine residents and visitors to use personal protective measures to prevent tick exposures. Personal protective measures include avoiding tick habitat, use of EPA approved repellents, wearing long sleeves and pants, and daily tick checks and tick removal after being in tick habitats (ticks must be attached >24 hours to transmit Lyme disease). Persons who have been in tick habitats should consult a medical provider if they have unexplained rashes, fever, or other unusual illnesses during the first several months after exposure. Possible community approaches to prevent Lyme disease include landscape management and control of deer herd populations.
VI.  A summary of laws of other states enacted during the past year related to the diagnosis, treatment and insurance coverage for Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses based on resources made available by federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or Other Organizations
Maine passed a law in 2013 entitled 'An Act to Inform Persons of the Options for the Treatment of Lyme Disease' which acknowledges the difficulty in diagnosing and treating Lyme disease, and provides information on the risks of long term antibiotic therapy.  Maine CDC updated our website to conform to the new requirements outlined in this law.

Summary
Lyme disease is a notifiable condition in the state of Maine.  The goal of Lyme disease surveillance is to help define demographic, geographic, and seasonal distribution; monitor disease trends; identify risk factors for transmission; and promote prevention and education efforts among the public and medical communities.  Reported cases are classified as confirmed, probable and suspect based on clinical symptoms and laboratory testing interpreted using criteria established by federal CDC.  The surveillance case definition is not intended to be used in clinical diagnosis.  Lyme disease surveillance is passive, dependent upon reporting, and therefore is likely to be an underrepresentation of the true burden of Lyme disease in Maine.
